i -I completed all parts of the assignment
ii -I encountered a persistent bug where I accidentally made a copy costructor where the Points2's sequence just pointed 
	to the rhs's sequence - Owen helped me fix this
	- I also couldn't get the operator + to work because I didn't create a new and I had redundant while loops - Blake helped me fix this
	-I also couldn't fill the array in the first place with ReadPoints - Professor Raja helped me fix this

iii	-You can run the code with a main that includes the permute and/or the Points2 class. From there, you can run Points2 with a text file or by typing in the points yourself on the terminal

iv -you can have a text file input if you wish. There is no output file
